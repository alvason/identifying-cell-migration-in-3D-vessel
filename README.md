# identifying cell migration by 3D vessel segmentation
This repository contains code for implementing vessel segmentation method initially described in the paper:
(is still working on this repository, a new package will be ready soon...)

## Overview
### Segmenting vessel under various fluid dynamics

## Installation
### Prerequisites
This code is written and tested in Python 3.6.5
The required Python libaries are:
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* AlvaMachinery

### Getting started
